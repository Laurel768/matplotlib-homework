The Power of Plots

Project Scope:


Pymaceuticals Inc., based out of San Diego, specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. 
In recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. 
Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. 
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

Various tables and graphs created with Pandas and Matplotlib will be used to illustrate the results of the study.
